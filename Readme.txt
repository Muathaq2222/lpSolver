This is the second version, much compact from the first version.
The software needs the following inputs from the user:

Variables:
	Enter all the variables, separated by comma. The variable type is fixed to non-negative variables.
Objective Type:
	Select the objective type.
Objective Function:
	Enter the objective function using +, -, * symbols.
Constraints:
	Enter constraints line by line. The constraints should have all the variables on the LHS and the constant on the RHS. Following symbols can be used for the constraints (without space):
	==    for equal to type constraint
	<=    for less than or equal to type constraint
	>=    for greater than or equal to type constraint



The software gives the following output:

The LP model:
	On the left output panel, you will see the LP that was solved.
The LP status:
	Optimal, unbounded, undefined(or infeasible)
The LP solution: 
	On the right output panel, you will see the LP solution.
